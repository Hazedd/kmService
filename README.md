The dutch rail infrastructure utilizes kilometer measurements to pinpoint the location of objects along the linear infrastructure.
This service aims to give you reference information from km and geocodes.

## Install

```batch
pip install kmService
```

## Usage

```py

async def async_example():
    from kmService import KmService

    km_service_instance = await KmService.factory()
    return km_service_instance

def sync_example():
    from kmService import get_km_service

    # we use the get_km_service methode, and use async in the background ðŸŽ‰
    km_service_instance = get_km_service()
    return km_service_instance

response = km_service_instance.get_km(x, y)
print(response.display)
print(response.geojson_string())
```
